# 30.007 Engineering Design Innovation
A robotic harvesting platform that automates detection and retrieval of matured crops in multi-tiered, vertical urban farms

## Sensing Rig 
Maturity detection is done using a Mask RCNN pretrained on COCO weights where the class identified is the local lettuce. When ready to h harvest, the actuation rig will harvest accordingly.

### Neural Network 
### CSV File Output 
Realtime logging of date, time, exact rack and column of the harvest is done with machine validation vs user validation done to better reinforce learning
